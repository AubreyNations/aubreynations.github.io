        <h1>Aubrey's Game!</h1>
        <p>This assignment was to create a program using prior information</p>
        <p>learned in class and also with new information regarding the subject</p>
        <p>chosen.</p> 
        <img src="Screencap2.jpg" />
        <p>I decided to create a game about a horned toad who grew</p>
        <p>wings and decided to defeat his natural enemies.</p>
        <img src="Screencap1.jpg" />
        <p>The most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to<p>
        <p>insert images into the program. After scowering the internet, we</p>
        <p>finally found the code to do so.</p>

        <p>This was an enjoyable project to work on because I was able to delve</p>
        <p>somewhat into gaming graphics, which is a large part of what I want to</p>
        <p>get out of computer science and programming. I was liberating to freely</p>
        <p>explore the things I was interested in.</p>
