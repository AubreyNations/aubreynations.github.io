        <p>I decided to create a game about a horned toad who grew</p>
        <p>wings and decided to defeat his natural enemies.</p>

        <p>The most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to<p>
        <p>insert images into the program. After scowering the internet, we</p>
        <p>finally found the code to do so.</p>
